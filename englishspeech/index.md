+ Hello everyone. I am Bao Ruofei from Class 191 of Excellence in Agricultural Electrification. The main topic of my speech is *Artificial Intelligence in my eyes.*

+ Artificial Intelligence is one of the three cutting-edge technologies in the 21st century. It has played an irreplaceable role in social production and life. It researches and develops theories, methods, technologies and applications for simulating, extending and expanding human intelligence system. As a branch of computer science, it attempts to understand the essence of intelligence and produce a new intelligent machine that can react in a similar way to human intelligence. It is the science of studying how to create intelligent machines or intelligent systems to simulate the ability of human intelligence activities to extend people's intelligence.

+ In my opinion, artificial intelligence can be understood in two parts, namely "artificial" and "intelligence". Artificial, naturally, is something that humans can do, and humans complete activities. Intelligence should be understood as wisdom and ability. The essence of artificial intelligence is the process of machine self-learning. Machine learning includes two major modules: one is the data source, which is big data; the other is the data processing method, which is the machine learning algorithm.

+ Once artificial intelligence is completed, it will have a huge subversion of the existing mobile Internet product business model, and even some of them will no longer exist. Its arrival will change the existing shopping, chat and communication methods, and even have an impact on social interaction.

+ Due to technical bottlenecks, artificial intelligence is far from reaching the point of maturity. Artificial intelligence based on big data analysis and processing can achieve accurate recommendations. However, there is a big bottleneck in using it to simulate humans. That is, it cannot simulate human characteristics such as emotions and morals. So we don't have to worry that artificial intelligence will rule humanity now. I believe it will eventually develop within the controllable range of mankind and benefit us in the future.
